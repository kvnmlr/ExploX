\section{Kevin M\"uller}
I am responsible for the complete implementation, where the main steps included
\begin{itemize}
\item setting up the server using Node.js.
\item implementing a secure user management as well as log-in via Strava (OAuth).
\item designing and implementing the database with tables for users, routes, activities and coordinates as well as spatial queries on geographic data.
\item doing front-end design and implementation using Jade as templating engine and Bootstrap.
\item integrating Leaflet.js with GeoJSON, MaskCanvas and Leaflet Routing Machine to display the activity map and routes. Preprocessing of the data in the backend.
\item implementating the relevant Strava API calls and corresponding database hooks to store and retrieve the data.
\item implementating a crawler to get all strava segments in a given area.
\item implementating the route generation algorithm as described in detail in the main paper.
\item implementating the user interface according to our paper prototypes for a good usability, especially for generating new routes.
\end{itemize}
... and of course some complementary work such as
\begin{itemize}
\item researching which libraries and services to use.
\item studying their documentations and APIs.
\item a lot of testing and debugging.
\item time management and issue tracking using the Github issue tracker.
\end{itemize}
... as well as project-related work including
\begin{itemize}
\item researching related work at the beginning of the seminar.
\item mostly doing implementation-related parts of the presentations and writing the implementation chapter of the report.
\item recording the video.
\item rather passively helping with the design of the study.
\end{itemize}

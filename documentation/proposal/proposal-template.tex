\section{Evaluation \& Testing}
Testing and Evaluation will be a key part of our project. We will split this into three parts. 
\subsection{First Part}
The first part starts soon. Therefore we will find five to ten athletes that participate in our study. If that works we will work together with the triathlon squad here in Saarbrücken. Each athlete will give us the permission to get their tracked Strava activities for research purposes. We collect the data for about ten days or two weeks and want the participants to write a training diary in this time. The advantage with the triathletes would be that they do training frequently also in winter. 
\subsection{Second Part}
The second part of the study will be around February. Then we will tell the participants, which product we are working on and give them admission to our web tool. Now they will do the same thing as before but with our software. This time the goal is to make them familiar with the tool and have them use it. After the had an introduction to the tool the participants start another ten days or two weeks this time using the software and writing diary also concerning the software. 
Our hypothesis is: Our tool will help athletes to get to know new places in a city.
\subsection{Third Part}
The third part will be the evaluation. After our software finally works we can now also calculate the “black map that fades away” with the gathered data from part one. So we can easily compare the two maps from part one with part two and do this with each athletes. 
To get more feedback we will also conduct semi-structured interviews with them or give them questionnaires of about two pages. Then we can also avoid complications like if an athlete was ill in one of the two parts or had other reasons not to use our software often we can consider this in the evaluation
Then we can see whether the athletes could discover new areas by looking at the two maps and either support or reject our hypothesis.
